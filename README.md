# Untitled Dating App
This is the api for my dating app which is a work in progress.
It has a twist to it which makes it 'different' to other dating apps, and obviously I won't be revealing the secret of the app. 

Most of the code is only in one file, because... why not? 

And so I've decided to continue development in a private repo. 

## Why is this here?
Here you can see:
```
- Lots of javascript examples by me
- How I implemented AWS into an API
- Example of token based authentication
```
